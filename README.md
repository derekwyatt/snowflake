The Snowflake Method in LaTeX
=============================

I read [The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/product/snowflake-method-book-snowflake-pro-coupon/),
written by [Randy Ingermanson](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/about-randy/) and found it
pretty intriguing.  It just might be a cool way to organize ideas when writing stories and such.
He's even got [an app](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/product/snowflake-pro-software/) that
helps you put it all together. But, _egads!_ Where's the LaTeX version!?

Here it is. Very much a work in progress. Everything could change.
